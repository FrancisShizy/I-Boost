\usage{
IBoost(X, Y, data.type, method = "permute", iter.max = 2000,
  v = ifelse(method == "permute", 0.01, 0.01), m.stop = 5,
  alpha.series = c(0.05, seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1)), n.fold = 5,
  permN = 100, seed = 12345678)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The matrix of all predictors. Each row represents a subject (with total of n rows) and each column represents a feature (with total of d columns). Each column of X should be standardized.}

\item{Y}{The survival time, represented by a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{data.type}{The list of indices representing the types of the predictors. Each element of the list is a vector of integers between 1 and d that corresponds to the column numbers of a type of predictors in X. The indices should be non-overlapping.}

\item{method}{The version of I-Boost to be used; “permute” for I-Boost-Permutation, and “CV” for I-Boost-CV.}

\item{iter.max}{The maximum number of iterations.}

\item{v}{The penalty factor for the current estimate at each iteration.}

\item{m.stop}{The stopping criterion; if the parameters are not updated consecutively for m.stop iterations, then the algorithm terminates.}

\item{alpha.series}{The set of values to be considered for the second tuning parameter in elastic net (\eqn{\alpha}) in cross-validation; only applicable when \code{method=”CV”}.}

\item{n.fold}{The number of folds in cross-validation for the selection of tuning parameters; only applicable when \code{method=”CV”}.}

\item{permN}{The number of permutation data sets; only applicable when \code{method="permute"}.}

\item{seed}{The initial random seed for partitioning the data set for cross-validation or generating permutation data sets.}
}
\value{
A list of two elements, \code{beta} and \code{iter.no}. \code{beta} is a vector of estimated regression parameters. \code{iter.no} is the number of iterations used in the estimation.
